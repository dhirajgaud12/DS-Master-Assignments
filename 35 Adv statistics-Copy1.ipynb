Uses- Percentile calculation,Visualizing and understanding the distribution of a random variable. It shows the cumulative probability of different values and can reveal patterns or characteristics of the data."

The parameters of the normal distribution if mean changes then the peak or top changes to left or right, if Standard deviation changes then it changes the width of the curve."

    "9) The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that states that the distribution of the sample means from a population with any underlying distribution approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. In simpler terms, it states that when you take repeated samples from a population and calculate their means, those means will tend to follow a bell-shaped or normal distribution, regardless of the population's distribution. \n",
    "Significance- Sampling Distribution: The Central Limit Theorem allows us to make inferences about a population based on a sample. Statistical Inference: The Central Limit Theorem is crucial for making valid statistical inferences. It enables the construction of confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and parameter estimation based on the assumption of a normal distribution of sample means."

    "Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) Samples: The samples taken from the population must be independent, meaning that the value of one sample does not influence the value of another. Additionally, the samples should be identically distributed, meaning that each sample is drawn from the same underlying population with the same distribution. \n",

    "Finite Variance: The population from which the samples are drawn must have a finite variance. This assumption ensures that the sample means are well-defined and do not exhibit extreme fluctuations.\n",
