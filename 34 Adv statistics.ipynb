    "10) The assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem are as follows:\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the sample should be independent of each other. Each observation should be unrelated to the others and not influenced by any external factors.\n",
    "Identically Distributed: The observations in the sample should be drawn from the same population and have the same probability distribution. This assumption ensures that each observation has the same underlying distribution and follows the same rules.\n",
    "Finite Variance: The population from which the sample is drawn should have a finite variance. This assumption implies that the spread of the population values is limited and not infinite.\n",
    "Sample Size: The Central Limit Theorem holds for large enough sample sizes. Although there is no specific threshold, a general rule of thumb is that the sample size should be at least 30. However, for some distributions, even smaller sample sizes can provide a good approximation to a normal distribution.\n"
